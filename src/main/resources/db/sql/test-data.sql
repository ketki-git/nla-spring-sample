INSERT INTO BOOK_INFO VALUES(3,'The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwells prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. 1984 is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia" -a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novels hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions -a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time. ')

So begins Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austens witty comedy of manners-one of the most popular novels of all time-that features splendidly civilized sparring between the proud Mr. Darcy and the prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet as they play out their spirited courtship in a series of eighteenth-century drawing-room intrigues. Renowned literary critic and historian George Saintsbury in 1894 declared it the "most perfect, the most characteristic, the most eminently quintessential of its authors works," and Eudora Welty in the twentieth century described it as "irresistible and as nearly flawless as any fiction could be."')
